# This code animates a given play in the player tracking data, and displays
# coverages.
#
# CONVENTION:
# 1) man-coverage: line connecting receiver and defender
# 2) zone-coverage: faded green circle around zone defender
# 3) **LBs are excluded, since the prompt asks for an analysis of
#    defensive backs. Defenders without (1) or (2) are either LBs or DLs

# Animating a Play --------------------------------------------------------

## Select Play
## 2018090912/2115 is an example of zone it gets right
## 2018090906/3594 is an example of a zone it gets wrong (but right for our purposes)
## 2018090900/4093 same as above
## 2018090901/4688 same as above
## 2018091001/1843 is an example of getting 2 zones correct and 1 wrong. Shows a need for
## recongnizing that no movement at all probably means zone! (had the most imp variable in
## his favor as well, confusing as to why this would assign zone)
## 2018090906/3223 seems just backwards --> CHECK THIS OUT!!! (maybe fumble related) (CHECK PROGRESSION HERE!)


## 2018090912/3849 an example of man coverage missed for one player because of traffic
## 2018090900/1260 another example of this! (maybe square numerator of ratio?!?!)
## 2018090905/1646 is another example, where 21 screws up the ratio metric

## could be solved by 1) pooling or 2) tracking classification at different stages (ie, after release)
## 2018090902/2316 needs to be fixed to detect zone

## KRYPTONITE FOR ZONE: 2018090910/3171 has Donte Jackson as man, because
## it cannot tell that he passed off 83 and then got 89, it just looks to the
## GMM like a continous flow with the same guy:
## track metric like "max % of time closest to specific offensive player"
## 2018090902/1302 #22 another example of this, passes off 11 for 84,
## algorithm cannot tell
## Also can get max correlation x/y direction, and average them
## crazy example of where correlation on all offensive players goes wrong!
## ****** TO DO TOMORROW: and then check that all the favorable results are
## maintained
## - solution: get correlation of motion with closest player (or one with
## same direction!!!!)

## KRYPTONIE FOR MAN: 2018090903/1336

## NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR BLITZ!!!!: 2018090903/2381
## 2018090910/676 as well!

## 2018090905/337: really interesting example of trips, with passing offf
## and covering man whoever comes to each side! CODE WORKED HERE, WANT TO SEE
## BROKEN DOWN BY POSSESSION INTERVAL!!!!

## ******************
## Check 2018091000/2177 by possession interval as well (22)
## issue here looks like the crowded beginning is throwing off the ratio
## could add a buffer to improve this behavior
## 2018090903/2597 as well exhibits this same behavior
## *****************

## and 2018091000/3393
## and 2018090903/596 (28 must be in man after the start)
## and 2018090909/3297
## and 2018090902/1815 (#21)

## 2018090907/936 is a literal perfect example of how this tagging works
## 2018091000/785 another great example
# **********2018090907/1382 is the perfect example!!!!!***********
# **********2018090907/3430 is another perfect example!!!*********
# **********2018090901/4596 another perfect example of how it gets the
# priciples correct, not necessarily the exact coverage
# **********2018090900/1260 also example of getting principles correct
## 2018090906/2748 shows 2 ways this method can go wrong:
## - 21: limited variation in a direction by WR leads to error in cors
## - 20: CB falling down or stopping once ball is thrown makes it look like zone

## 2018090901/2885 shows the same issue as above with limited variablity:
## what if we did a coord switch for corr to ensure adequate variablitiy in both dirs?!?!?
## use #28 as an example here!
## ****** SOLUTION: ROTATE about ball_snap point 45Ëš, and take maximum!!!!!!!! ***********


## FOR SAFETIES: 2018090912/3849 great example of code working!
## 2018090910/477 another good one!
